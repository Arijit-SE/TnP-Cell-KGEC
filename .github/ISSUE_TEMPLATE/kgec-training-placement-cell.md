The management of the Training and Placement Cell is currently supported by paper-based systems, databases, and email communications. The aim of this project is to automate the manual labor of Training and Placement Cell of KGEC. This is a web site which will help students, companies as well as the TPO to carry out placement related activities. The web site can be accessed from all devices using the proper credentials.
Every student and company will register themselves to the web site. The TPO will verify the well-grounded companies using the supporting document provided by the company. Afterwards, the companies will be able to post the placement drives. Soon after, the eligible students will be able to apply to those placement drives. The web site can be used as a platform by the TPO as well as the companies for managing student information of the placement drives.
